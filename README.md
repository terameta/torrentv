# TorrenTV 

Idea is to create an Apple/Android/Roku/etc application to stream content directly from a Torrent file.

- Probably, I can add either a mobile app or a webserver for adding torrent files
- Again probably, but better yet, make the app automatically search for videos online, and the user only selects movie / TV series
- Save only metadata no need to save the video anywhere, but save it to either on the device or allow the user to select a cloud storage location, e.g. Google Drive
- Also, maybe allow user to add a network drive/S3 bucket/Azure Bucket/GCP bucket/Google Drive as a source of videos
- Automatically find subtitles
